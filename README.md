How to play:

The goal of the game is to eliminate the other color. To do this, you must attack the other color's squares. In order to do that, you must have a bridge(per say) made of your own color. To create this bridge, you must expand into the gray spaces. This is done by left clicking one of your squares, then left clicking on an ajacent gray square. You will be asked how many troops to move, then they will move. You may do this as many times as you like on your turn, which is ended by clicking the End Your Turn button. When this happens, the button will change to the other color, and all of the controlled squares will increase their troop count by 1. If you attempt to move onto the other color's square, it will initiate a battle, in which the side with more troops wins, but subtracts troops, and the loser subtracts all of his/her troops.
